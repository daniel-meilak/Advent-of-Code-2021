## Day 22

Difficult day. Optimized version of my code [day_22_old.cpp](day_22_old.cpp) does provide an answer however only after 16 seconds! So instead, had a look at [/r/Boojum's](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/rlxhmg/comment/hpizza8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) answer, which I then [transtlated](day_22.cpp) to C++. Finishes in only a few milliseconds.
